# Data Visualisation

## Introduction

### Aim of the Assignment
The aim of this assignment is to create a data visualisation from a dataset that we source ourselves. We are to use Processing, a language built off the Java language that is used for electronic art and visual design.

### What is Data Visualisation?
Data visualisation tells a visual story using some feature of a dataset. This helps to put the data into context, allowing a person to easily understand the meaning of the data. It is a landscape that you can explore, an 'Information Map' that helps to guide you when your are lost in the information.

Data is used to create new insight and new ideas, it helps us to solve information problems. A data visualisation helps a person to look beyond the data and numbers, and lets them abstract the information that they deem to be important.
